# Kortex Project Governance

This document describes the governance model for the Kortex project.

## Overview

Kortex is currently maintained under a **Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL)** governance model. This means that while the project welcomes contributions from the community, final decisions on project direction, features, and releases are made by the project maintainer.

## Roles

### Maintainer

**Current Maintainer**: [Jude Oyovbaire](https://github.com/judeoyovbaire)

The maintainer is responsible for:

- Setting the project vision and roadmap
- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Managing releases
- Responding to issues and community questions
- Making final decisions on technical direction
- Ensuring the project adheres to CNCF guidelines and best practices

### Contributors

Anyone who contributes to the project through:

- Code contributions (pull requests)
- Documentation improvements
- Bug reports and feature requests
- Community support and advocacy
- Testing and feedback

All contributors are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Decision Making

### Technical Decisions

Technical decisions are made through the following process:

1. **Discussion**: Issues or proposals are discussed in GitHub Issues or Pull Requests
2. **Consensus Seeking**: The maintainer seeks input from the community
3. **Final Decision**: The maintainer makes the final call, taking community input into account

### Roadmap

The project roadmap is maintained in the [README](README.md) and reflects the maintainer's vision for the project. Community input on roadmap priorities is welcome through GitHub Issues.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome and encouraged. Please see our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on:

- How to submit pull requests
- Coding standards and guidelines
- The review process

## Future Governance

As the Kortex community grows, this governance model may evolve. Potential future changes include:

- Addition of co-maintainers
- Formation of a technical steering committee
- Transition to a more distributed governance model

Any significant changes to governance will be discussed openly with the community before implementation.
